			<h3>About me</h3>
		
				Hello! Welcome to my web page. Mthobisi is <br>
				a Junior Java Developer and Python Programmer,<br>
				 also qualified as an Electrical Technician <br>
				currently working for PG Bison. For close to 5 years,<br>
				I have worked with PLCs such as Siemens, Mitsubishi, <br>Schneider, 
				Delta and etc.
				<br><br>
				Up until recently when I decided to follow my <br>
				passion which is being the "mastermind" behind the Software.<br>
				I enrolled for a Software Engineering Bootcamp <br>
				with Hyperion Development in which we covered Python and Java.<br>(
				Java OOP, MySQL, Big O Notation,HTML basics and many other <br>
				programming techniques ).
		 
				<br><br>
		  
		 		I love structure and order, and I also stand for quality.<br>
		 		I spend majority of my time learning new programming skills<br>
		 		and techniques so to enhance my logical and technical approach<br>
		 		in the tech industry. I also prefer spending much time on <br>
		 		fixing little details and optimizing software projects. <br>
		 		I like working in a team, you'll learn faster and much more.<br>
		 		As the saying goes: 'two heads  are better than one'. From <br>
		 		the learned techniques I have developed real life projects.

				<p>
					Hello! Welcome to my web page. Mthobisi is <br>
					a Java Developer and Python Programmer,<br>
				    also qualified as an Electrical Technician <br>
					currently working for PG Bison. For close to 5 years,<br>
					I have worked with PLCs such as Siemens, Mitsubishi, <br>Schneider, 
					Delta and etc.
					<br><br>
					Up until recently when I decided to follow my <br>
					passion which is being the "mastermind" behind the Software.<br>
					I enrolled for a Software Engineering Bootcamp <br>
					with Hyperion Development in which we covered Python and Java.<br>(
					Java OOP, MySQL, Big O Notation,HTML,CSS,Bootstrap and many other <br>
					programming techniques ).
		 
					<br><br>
		  
		 			I love structure and order, and I also stand for quality.<br>
		 			I spend majority of my time learning new programming skills<br>
		 			and techniques so to enhance my logical and technical approach<br>
		 			in the tech industry. I also prefer spending much time on <br>
		 			fixing little details and optimizing software projects. <br>
		 			I like working in a team, you'll learn faster and much more.<br>
		 			As the saying goes: 'two heads  are better than one'. From <br>
		 			the learned techniques I have developed real life projects.
